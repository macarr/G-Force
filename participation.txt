Well guys, at this point I have to say that the only two people who have been making some serious contribution to this
project are myself and Joy. Please be reminded that in order to get at least a 'B' from me for the project, each
individual  has to implement at least one important aspect of this project. Sorry to say this, but taking care of the 
reports is not really a big help. There still are coding defects in the project which need to be solved. For example, 
the icepdf is throwing a message on the console which needs to be fixed. I would hope that the team-members who have
made zero or close to zero contribution would spend some time on finding out how to fix the icepdf problem. Someone also
needs to make a splash-screen for the application.
